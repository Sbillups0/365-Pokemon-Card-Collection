## Collector Example Flow
Misty, a dedicated water Pokemon card collector, isn't interested in battling. Instead, she is looking very hard and closely for new cards to grow collection. Especially, the "Prismatic Evolution" pack. She's hoping to pull rare evolutions of classic Pok√©mon to expand her collection and display her favorites.

First, Misty request a catalog to see the latest packs available in the catalog by calling `GET /packs/catalog`. She sees in the catalog, there is Shrouded Fable, Surging Sparks, Paldean Fates, or Crown Zenith.

Misty decides to buy the Paldean Fates pack, open the pack, and display her favorite cards. To do so she:

- starts by calling `POST /users/misty_id/purchase_pack/Paldean Fates`
- then Misty decides to open her new exciting pack, by calling `POST /users/misty_id/open_pack/Paldean Fates/1`
- she decides to view her collection making another call `GET /users/misty_id/collection`
= finally she shows off her favorite pull - Prismatic Umbreon by calling `POST /users/misty_id/display/Prismatic_Umbreon`
