Fire Deck Creation and Battle Example Flow  
Timmy the witiful battler wants to prep for his pokemon battle competition by creating a fire type deck using the most powerful pokemon. She filters the card collection such that only the fire type pokemon cards are shown using SELECT cards from pokemon where type in ('Fire'). Her query gives her the fire pokemon cards available: Charizard, Blaziken, Reshiram, Dragonite, and Flareon. She wants to use these pokemon to make a deck. She uses her user id along with INSERT INTO decks (DeckName, User) VALUE ("Fire Lords",Timmy). The server responds that the deck has been created and added to her account. Timmy is confident with all the strong cards in the deck and decides to go battle a user. He runs INSERT INTO battles(DeckName, User) VALUE ("Fire Lords",Timmy). The server is able to process his battle request and Timmy's Fire Lords fought magnificiently and defeated the foe. The win has earned Timmy 600 Pokemon coins and a rare card reward.
